# Customer Churn Prediction (End-to-End ML Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn (whether a customer will leave a company) using machine learning.  
This project will cover the full Data Science lifecycle:
- Data Collection & Exploration
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Model Deployment (Streamlit App)
- Monitoring & Documentation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP)
- Google Colab (free environment for ML)
- Streamlit Cloud (for app deployment)
- GitHub (for version control & portfolio)

## 🎯 Expected Deliverables
- Jupyter notebooks with EDA, feature engineering, and modeling
- Trained ML model for churn prediction
- Interactive Streamlit app for churn prediction
- Documentation of process and results

## 📂 Dataset
We are using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** from Kaggle.
